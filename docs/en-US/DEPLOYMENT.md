# GMPay Edge deployment checklist

[简体中文](../zh-CN/DEPLOYMENT.md) · English

This checklist deploys one single-tenant GMPay Edge instance on Cloudflare
Workers or Bun/Nitro. Operators use
`/admin`; merchants integrate only through the signed GMPay protocol or its
EPay boundary adapter.

## Deployment paths

### Deploy button

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/GMWalletApp/gmpay-edge)

The guided flow forks the repository and configures Workers Builds. The source
repository must be public when the button is used. Configure `bun run build` as
the Build command and `wrangler deploy` as the Deploy command. The build command
reuses exact named D1, KV, R2, and Queue resources, creates only missing ones,
applies the D1 baseline, and compiles a Vite artifact containing the resolved
D1/KV IDs. The portable source `wrangler.jsonc` is never rewritten.
When deployment finishes, open `/install` on the Worker URL.

### Wrangler CLI

Authenticate Wrangler and run the package deployment command. Its `predeploy`
hook reuses exact named D1, KV, R2, and Queue resources, creates only missing
ones, applies the D1 baseline, and builds the resolved Vite artifact before
publication:

```bash
bun install
bunx wrangler login
bun run deploy
```

If necessary, prepare D1 manually with `bunx wrangler d1 create gmpay-edge`
and then `bun run db:migrate:remote`. Keep the generated database ID out of the
portable source configuration.

### Bun and Docker

The public [GHCR package](https://github.com/orgs/GMWalletApp/packages/container/package/gmpay-edge)
supports `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`. No registry login is required.

| Tag | Recommended use |
| --- | --- |
| `latest` | Latest stable release |
| `alpha` | Latest prerelease for testing |
| `1.0.0` | Fixed release for reproducible deployment |

#### Docker Compose

Save the following as `compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  gmpay-edge:
    image: ghcr.io/gmwalletapp/gmpay-edge:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      GMPAY_DATA_DIR: /var/lib/gmpay
    volumes:
      - gmpay-data:/var/lib/gmpay

volumes:
  gmpay-data:
```

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

To test a prerelease, change `latest` to `alpha` before starting the service.

#### Docker command

If Compose is not available, run the container directly:

```bash
docker volume create gmpay-data
docker run --detach --name gmpay-edge --restart unless-stopped \
  --publish 3000:3000 \
  --env GMPAY_DATA_DIR=/var/lib/gmpay \
  --volume gmpay-data:/var/lib/gmpay \
  ghcr.io/gmwalletapp/gmpay-edge:latest
```

#### First-time setup

Wait for `GET /healthz` to succeed, then open `/install` on the public URL.
Confirm the detected address and Allowed Hosts before creating the first root
user. Configure application, security, and email settings in the admin
interface; do not add them as container environment variables.

`GMPAY_DATA_DIR` points to the persistent directory. It contains SQLite,
uploaded files, private objects, queue state, and all other runtime data. Back
up and preserve the named volume whenever the container is updated or recreated.

#### Common commands

Verify and operate a Compose deployment with:

```bash
curl --fail http://127.0.0.1:3000/healthz
docker compose ps
docker compose logs --follow gmpay-edge
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

The final two commands update the selected tag and recreate the container while
keeping the named volume.

To build the Bun artifact from source, run `bun run build:bun`. The Workers
commands remain exactly as above and continue to use the Cloudflare Vite adapter.
For backups, restores, and D1/R2 migration, follow
[Bun data operations](NODE_DATA_OPERATIONS.md) and use the maintained `data`
package script with its `backup`, `restore`, and `import-cloudflare` subcommands.

## Cloudflare resources

- [ ] Configure at least one provider under **Admin → Email delivery**. To use Cloudflare Email, bind Email Routing as `EMAIL` and confirm that the Workers-only provider appears. Send a live recovery email and confirm the 15-minute link works; the sign-in page deliberately returns a generic response when delivery is unavailable.
- [ ] Confirm the Workers build creates or reuses the `gmpay-edge` D1 database and links it as `DB`.
- [ ] Build once and verify the Wrangler `assets.directory` publishes `dist/client`; static files are served by Cloudflare's platform asset handling without exposing an `ASSETS` binding to application code, while application and API routes continue through the Worker.
- [ ] Confirm the deploy log reads `dist/server/wrangler.json` with `main: index.js` and `no_bundle: true`; Wrangler must not rebundle `src/server-entry.ts` or report unresolved `#tanstack-router-entry`/`#tanstack-start-entry` modules.
- [ ] Confirm the Workers build creates or reuses the private R2 bucket `gmpay-edge-files` and links it as `FILES`.
- [ ] Keep `gmpay-edge-files` private and configure an R2 lifecycle policy for payer-submitted review evidence; evidence is served only through the authenticated Worker route.
- [ ] Confirm the Workers build creates or reuses the `gmpay-edge-cache` KV namespace and links it as `CACHE`.
- [ ] Verify an `audit:create` user can export audit logs and that an NDJSON artifact appears under `exports/audit-logs/` in R2. Structured secret fields are redacted and the export action is itself audited.
- [ ] Create a signed test order with a public HTTPS `notify_url`; verify GMPay JSON/EPay query signatures with the creating API credential's current Secret, then explicitly resend the order notification and confirm a new delivery record is retained.
- [ ] Edit a test RPC credential and confirm the node is disabled with its previous health result cleared; test it successfully before enabling it again.
- [ ] Disable the final ready receiving method for a test asset and confirm it disappears from the public/API catalog; re-enable it only after target and access validation succeed.
- [ ] Edit a Binance, OKX, or OKPay receiving method's read-only account configuration and confirm the receiving method remains disabled until its replacement identity and access pass validation.
- [ ] Trigger **Sync rates** with one intentionally unavailable test source; verify other pairs update, the failed observation keeps its prior expiry, and the audit summary contains no provider response body.
- [ ] Grant a test role `operations:read` without `operations:update`; verify it can inspect health but cannot run manual recovery tasks. Then grant update and test each bounded task separately.
- [ ] Rotate a test Telegram Bot Token and confirm its existing subscriptions remain, the new bot receives the secret-token Webhook, and the old token is revoked or its Webhook removed.
- [ ] Confirm the Workers build creates or reuses `gmpay-edge-webhooks`, `gmpay-edge-webhooks-dlq`, `gmpay-edge-payments`, and `gmpay-edge-payments-dlq`; producers are linked as `WEBHOOK_QUEUE` and `PAYMENT_QUEUE`.
- [ ] Deploy Queue producers and consumers from the same release; payloads require the explicit `webhook.delivery`, `payment.scan`, or `payment.provider_event` kind with `version: 1`.
- [ ] For each enabled Alchemy event source, use a dedicated Address Activity webhook, verify the copied HTTPS callback URL and Allowed Host, and confirm reconciliation validates the remote type, network, URL, active state, and addresses before reporting healthy.
- [ ] Complete an Alchemy shadow-mode low-value drill before activating accounting; inspect the provider-event row, exercise one eligible manual retry, and confirm a duplicate or changed delivery cannot create extra payment events.
- [ ] Keep the Webhook consumer retry/DLQ policy enabled for Worker crashes. GMPay Edge persists and schedules application-level Webhook attempts separately in D1, so `webhooks.max_attempts` may exceed one Queue message's `max_retries` without leaving deliveries stuck in `failed`.
- [ ] Confirm `bun run deploy` creates or reuses `gmpay-edge` and applies the D1 baseline before publication; use `bun run db:migrate:remote` only for an explicit database-only run.
- [ ] Complete `/install`; it generates authentication/signing values and payment defaults, requires confirmation of the detected Origin, stores it as the application URL and an Allowed Host, and signs the root user in automatically.
- [ ] Open **Forgot password**, receive the 15-minute one-time link, reset the password, and confirm previous sessions no longer authenticate.
- [ ] Review **Admin → System settings → Authentication** and **Secret management**; verify the production HTTPS origin and back up `runtime.better_auth_secret` with D1.
- [ ] Configure each intended provider according to [PAYMENT_METHODS.md](PAYMENT_METHODS.md); use read-only exchange credentials and verify token identifiers and decimals.
- [ ] Configure crypto and fiat rate sync settings; use **Run now** in each settings dialog once, verify raw/final observations, then confirm the one-minute Cron respects each category's automatic-sync switch and saved interval.

## Bun resources

- [ ] Confirm the container runs as its non-root user and the persisted directory is writable only by the intended host/container identity.
- [ ] Confirm the volume contains `gmpay.sqlite`, private objects, and durable queue state after installation and a test upload/order.
- [ ] Configure a supported Bun email provider and send a password-recovery test. Confirm the provider list matches Workers and no email secret appears in the container environment.
- [ ] Restart the container and confirm queued Webhook/payment work and scheduled jobs resume without duplicate accounting or delivery.
- [ ] Stop the container, run `bun run data -- backup` to an external location, restore with `bun run data -- restore` into a new data directory, and verify manifest, SQLite integrity, migration checksum, sign-in, and private-object access.
- [ ] When migrating from Workers, run `bun run data -- import-cloudflare` against explicit D1 SQL and optional R2 export paths; import only into a new or empty target, then repeat signed order and callback acceptance tests.

## Automated releases

Semantic-release runs after the quality gate on both release channels. `alpha`
starts at `1.0.0-alpha.1` and publishes only full-version and moving `alpha`
container tags. Once verified and merged, `main` publishes stable `1.0.0` plus
major, minor, and `latest` tags. It updates `package.json` and `bun.lock`, creates
the GitHub Release with generated notes and a tag, then calls the independent
Docker smoke and multi-architecture publish workflow. Native x64 and Arm64
runners build and smoke-test their platform images in parallel before the
workflow assembles the published manifest. After a stable image and its
provenance are published, matching alpha GitHub prereleases, remote Git tags,
and GHCR image versions are deleted automatically.

The `gmpay-edge` GHCR package is public. Release acceptance verifies an
unauthenticated pull.

## Release gate

- [ ] `bun run typecheck`
- [ ] `bun run test`
- [ ] `bun run check`
- [ ] `bun run build`
- [ ] `bun run build:bun`
- [ ] Open sign-in and verify an uninitialized deployment redirects to root-user initialization.
- [ ] Create and enable the intended asset, channel, and receiving address; development-only mock channels must never be enabled unintentionally in production.
- [ ] Verify binding-free `GET/HEAD /healthz`, detailed `/status`, root-user initialization, sign-in, and one signed GMPay end-to-end order in the intended channel.
- [ ] Confirm merchant notification targets use public HTTPS, provider/Telegram inbound paths validate their provider-specific signatures, and GMPay/EPay outbound signatures match the documented canonical parameters.
- [ ] Confirm no `.dev.vars`, wallet keys, merchant secrets, or Cloudflare tokens are tracked.
- [ ] Smoke-test the selected production runtime; when releasing, verify the GHCR image digest and both architectures from the GitHub Release.
- [ ] Verify the public GHCR image can be pulled without authentication.
